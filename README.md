# Cryptocurrency Market App

Overview: This is a mobile application developed using React Native and Expo that allows users to view cryptocurrency market data such as names, prices, and trends in real-time. Users can create an account and log in to access additional features like password resets and account management. The app uses APIs from CoinGecko and Firebase to fetch and store data respectively.

Technologies: React Native, Expo, JavaScript, Firebase, CoinGecko

Features:

Real-time cryptocurrency market data from CoinGecko API
Account creation, login, password resets, and user account management using Firebase API
Cross-platform development using React Native and Expo for iOS and Android
User-friendly interface and easy navigation
Challenges: The main challenge faced by the developer was setting up the development environment to start coding with React Native and Expo. There were also issues encountered while importing files from Mac to Windows, which caused problems in file types and variables. Another challenge was ensuring that the app worked properly on physical devices and that it displayed the correct data from the API.

Lessons Learned: The developer learned the importance of creating backups and being cautious when making changes to the code. Additionally, the importance of researching and asking for help when encountering issues was also highlighted.

Future Improvements: The developer plans to add more features to the app like a search function and notifications for price alerts. They also plan to improve the UI and UX by adding more customization options and filters for market data.
